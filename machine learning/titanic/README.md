# Predict if the person is still alive
## Task
I will use **titanic dataset** (from *seaborn* module) and *sklearn* module for machine learning. The task is to make a model which will predict if the person is dead/alive.

Types of models, from which i will choose: **LinearRegression, PolynomialRegression, GaussianNB, PolynomialNB, SVC** (support vectors classification)

## Documentation
This will be the first project where i will try to write kind of documentation. It will include: 
1) **Filling missing values** and **Features projection** in DataFrame i will get from dataset.
2) Comparing **models accuracy**. Here i will experiment with types of models and their parameters. Also i will try to attach some graphs and diagrams

I guess that during completing the task the list of themes in documentation will increase.
