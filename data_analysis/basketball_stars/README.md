# Basketball stars statistics

## Dataset
I got this dataset from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/xvivancos/michael-jordan-kobe-bryant-and-lebron-james-stats).
Here we can see the information about three basketball players: *Michael Jordan*, *Kobe Bryant* and *Lebron James*.
There are different features: teams, salaries, ages, positions, shots accuracy, etc. These all can be used to describe
players performance and compare them with each other.
## Task
Let's analyze each player's statistics and decide, who is the best!

### Salaries (*salaries.csv*)
- [x] Show each player's total, average salary
- [x] Find each player's max, min salary during one season
- [x] Analyze players separately: show salary changes during career
#### Note
Of course, all these players played in different time. It will be good to analyze their performance in seasons, during
which they played together. This will minimize the influence of seasons. But, for example, Michael Jordan ended his 
career before Lebron James started playing in NBA. Even without looking on dataset it is easy to predict, that Lebron's 
average salary is higher than Michael's (because after Jordan's career salaries increased). Keep in mind this fact 
while looking on the pictures with players information.
### To be decided...
